## Investigation Findings

Analysis of system logs confirmed the creation of a new user account and modification of scheduled task configurations.

The changes occurred shortly after prior unauthorized activity and were not associated with any approved administrative action.

The timing and nature of the activity strongly suggest an attempt to establish persistence, allowing continued access to the system even after credentials are changed.
