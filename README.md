# SOC Investigation Notes

This repository contains documented security incident investigations performed during hands-on SOC practice in a simulated lab environment.

Each investigation is written as a **single documentation file**, focusing on:
- what was observed  
- how the issue was investigated  
- what evidence was found  
- the final conclusion  

The purpose is to practice **analyst thinking**, not tool configuration or detection engineering.

## What This Repository Contains

For every investigation, a single file is created that includes:

- What triggered the alert or suspicion  
- How the investigation was performed  
- Logs and evidence reviewed  
- Key findings  
- Final analyst conclusion  

This approach keeps documentation simple and readable.

## Tools Used

- Wazuh  
- Linux system logs  
- TryHackMe SOC labs  

---

## Investigation Format

Each investigation file follows this structure:

- **What happened**
- **How I investigated**
- **What I found**
- **Conclusion**

---

## Note

All investigations were performed in a **simulated lab environment** for learning purposes only.  
No real systems or production data were involved.

# 🛡️ SOC Investigation Portfolio

This repository contains my ongoing SOC investigation practice.

I use this space to document how I analyze security events, investigate suspicious activity, and understand attacker behavior using SIEM and monitoring tools.

The goal is to improve my investigation skills and build a clear blue team–focused portfolio.

---

## 🔍 What You’ll Find Here

This repository is updated continuously as I complete new investigations.

Each investigation focuses on topics such as:

- Suspicious login activity  
- Brute-force attempts  
- Unauthorized access  
- Initial access indicators  
- Privilege escalation behavior  
- Persistence-related activity  

All cases are written in a simple and structured investigation format.

## 🧠 How I Approach Investigations

For every case, I try to follow a basic SOC mindset:

- Identify unusual behavior  
- Analyze relevant logs  
- Look for patterns and correlations  
- Validate findings using evidence  
- Map activity to MITRE ATT&CK  
- Write a clear conclusion  

This helps me think like a SOC analyst instead of just running tools.

## 🧰 Tools Used

- Elastic (Kibana)  
- Splunk  
- Wazuh   

Tools and techniques may expand as I continue learning.

---

## 📂 Structure

Investigations are organized by platform and case folders.

Each case usually includes:
- a markdown investigation report  
- screenshots as evidence  
- queries or analysis notes  

This makes it easy to add new investigations over time.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository is part of my learning journey toward becoming a SOC analyst.

It focuses on practical investigation skills, documentation, and continuous improvement.

---

## 📌 Note

All investigations are performed in lab or simulated environments only.  
No real systems or real user data are involved.
