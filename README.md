# 🛡️ SOC Investigation Portfolio

This repository contains my ongoing SOC investigation practice.

I use this space to document how I analyze security events, investigate suspicious activity, and understand attacker behavior using SIEM and monitoring tools.

The goal is to improve my investigation skills and build a clear blue team–focused portfolio.

## 🔍 What You’ll Find Here

This repository is updated continuously as I complete new investigations.

Each investigation focuses on topics such as:

- Suspicious login activity  
- Brute-force attempts  
- Unauthorized access  
- Initial access indicators  
- Privilege escalation behavior  
- Persistence-related activity  

All cases are written in a simple and structured investigation format.

## 🧠 How I Approach Investigations

For every case, I try to follow a basic SOC mindset:

- Identify unusual behavior  
- Analyze relevant logs  
- Look for patterns and correlations  
- Validate findings using evidence  
- Map activity to MITRE ATT&CK  
- Write a clear conclusion  

This helps me think like a SOC analyst instead of just running tools.

## 🧰 Tools Used

- Elastic (Kibana)  
- Splunk  
- Wazuh   

Tools and techniques may expand as I continue learning.

---

## 📂 Structure

Investigations are organized by platform and case folders.

Each case usually includes:
- a markdown investigation report  
- screenshots as evidence  
- queries or analysis notes  

This makes it easy to add new investigations over time.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository is part of my learning journey toward becoming a SOC analyst.

It focuses on practical investigation skills, documentation, and continuous improvement.
