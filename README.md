# SOC Investigation Notes

This repository contains documented security incident investigations performed during hands-on SOC practice in a simulated lab environment.

Each investigation is written as a **single documentation file**, focusing on:
- what was observed  
- how the issue was investigated  
- what evidence was found  
- the final conclusion  

The purpose is to practice **analyst thinking**, not tool configuration or detection engineering.

## What This Repository Contains

For every investigation, a single file is created that includes:

- What triggered the alert or suspicion  
- How the investigation was performed  
- Logs and evidence reviewed  
- Key findings  
- Final analyst conclusion  

This approach keeps documentation simple and readable.
